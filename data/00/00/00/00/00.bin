is another man's piece of cake.

160
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,833
(INHALES AND EXHALES DEEPLY)

161
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:18,291
-So, you're gonna prune me?
-I like that idea.

162
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:21,583
But, you know, my standards might be a
little bit higher in that area than yours.

163
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:24,791
-You know, with close personal friends.
-I'm sorry, Mobius.

164
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,083
I couldn't let you get in the way
of our mission.

165
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,166
Mission?

166
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,500
The Time-Keepers are fake.
We're all Variants. What mission?

167
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:36,208
It can't have been for nothing.
That's why I had to prune you.

168
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:39,333
Hunter D-90 to my office, immediately.

169
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:42,625
Yeah. Sorry, Ravonna. That's not gonna
work out the way you think it is,

170
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,416
now that we know your secret.

171
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:47,958
What did you do?

172
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,416
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

173
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,583
HUNTER U-92: Stay alert, she's close.

174
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:01,041
Secure the perimeter. I've got her.

175
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,083
Stand down, B-15.

176
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,625
You need to listen to me.

177
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:16,458
-HUNTER U-92: There'll be time for that.
-Just wait.

178
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:19,250
What the hell is going on here?

179
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,791
Judge Renslayer.

180
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:22,916
What?

181
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:26,291
Who are you? And what the hell
are you doing in my school?

182
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,958
That isn't Judge Renslayer. (SIGHS)

183
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,500
How?

184
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,416
We have a lot to talk about.

185
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:39,000
Been a long journey for you, hasn't it?

186
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,375
Lot of running, lot of pain.

187
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:44,666
And you... (SPUTTERS)

188
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:48,375
You're a flea on the back
of a dragon. (CHUCKLES)

189
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,125
In for one hell of a ride.

190
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,666
But you did manage to hang on.

191
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,000
Mmm-hmm. I guess
that counts for something.

192
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,166
I'm not sure you quite understand
the situation.

193
00:13:58,916 --> 00:13:59,916
You've lost.

194
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:02,583
We found you.

195
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:06,750
Duh. Of course you did.

196
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:08,625
-(SYLVIE GRUNTS)
-Whoa!

197
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:10,000
A swing and a miss.

198
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,375
-(SYLVIE GROWLS)
-(LAUGHS)

199
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,041
So, we're still doing that, hmm?

200
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,250
Let's get all this out of the way.

201
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:21,541
Okay.

202
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:23,583
Here we go.

203
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:29,708
You can't kill me because

204
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:33,291
I already know what's going to happen.

205
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,500
See?

206
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:43,041
It's a parlor trick.

207
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,458
Okay.

208
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:49,916
Don't you wonder how I'm able to get out
of the way just before you kill me?

209
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,708
No. It's because of that little TemPad
you have there.

210
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:53,791
HE WHO REMAINS: Right.

211
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:59,500
But how do I already have it loaded up
with everything I need to know

212
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,833
to keep from being killed by you two?

213
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,125
It's easy.

214
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,166
I know it all.

215
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,041
And I've seen it all.

216
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:14,791
Everything you guys
did on Lamentis, I saw.

217
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:19,208
All the stuff the TVA
didn't know about, I knew.

218
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:23,125
All the scheming, all the...

219
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,000
(TUTS) ...talking.

220
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,958
That little look by the lake.

221
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:35,291
Quite sentimental, very touching stuff,
by the way.

222
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:37,916
No.

223
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,958
No, we broke out of your little game.
That's how we got here.

224
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,833
HE WHO REMAINS: No, wrong.

225
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:47,958
Every step you took to get here,

226
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:50,333
Lamentis, The Void,

227
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:55,541
I paved the road.

228
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:58,916
You...

229
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,500
You just walked down it.

230
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:09,541
And I have the rest,
uh, right here.

231
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,208
Everything that's, uh...

232
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:17,250
that's going to happen.
There's only one way this can go.

233
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,250
Then why are we here?

234
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,583
Oh, come on.

235
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:25,583
You know you can't get to the end
until you've been changed by the journey.

236
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:28,458
This stuff, it needs to happen.

237
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:34,916
To get us all in the right mindset
to finish the quest.

238
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,166
-Right.
-HE WHO REMAINS: Right.

239
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,583
So, it's all a game.

240
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:42,333
It's all... a manipulation.

241
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:47,583
Interesting, that your head
would go to that.

242
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,458
Sylvie,

243
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
you think you can trust this guy?

244
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:55,750
-Don't listen to him.
-"Don't listen to him." (LAUGHS)

245
00:16:55,833 --> 00:17:00,666
Do you think you're even capable
of trusting anyone at all?

246
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,875
I think people are ready
to hear a little truth now.

247
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,666
You know, like the TVA is a lie.

248
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,541
But what if it's a necessary one?

249
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,666
Someone created the Time-Keepers.

250
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,583
They created this whole place.
They gave us all purpose.

251
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:20,875
I have to believe they had a reason.

252
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:24,250
No, because I've seen the horror
waiting for people when they get pruned

253
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,125
and there's nothing necessary
about that.

254
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:29,125
You know what would happen
if we didn't prune the Timeline?

255
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,125
-MOBIUS: What?
-Chaos. Death.

256
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:32,208
Free will?

257
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:34,375
(SCOFFS) Free will?

258
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:38,250
Only one person gets free will.
The one in charge.

259
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:47,208
"Friends across time, allies to the end."

260
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:49,416
-Shut up.
-MOBIUS: That was so beautiful.

261
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,833
And then you sent me to die.
What happened to you?

262
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,333
Nothing, Mobius. I didn't change.

263
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,041
You didn't change? You betrayed me.

264
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:58,875
No, no. You betrayed me!

265
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:03,916
I looked out for you,
hung my neck out for you,

266
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,250
and you suffer a crisis of faith
and turn to those Variants?

267
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:10,625
Eons of friendship.

268
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,916
And you threw it all away
on a couple of Lokis.

269
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,125
No, Mobius. I didn't betray you.

270
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:25,500
We can't take away people's free will,
Ravonna. Do you not see that?

271
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,958
-What are you doing?
-What I need to do.

272
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:30,791
Wait, stop.

273
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:34,583
Look, maybe we can build this
into something better together.

274
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,791
(SCOFFS) I'm sorry, Mobius.

275
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,375
I'm not gonna let you go.

276
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:42,458
RENSLAYER: Please, Mobius.

277
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,083
Even with that...

278
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,291
you're of no danger to me.

279
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:49,916
Is that what you think?

280
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:51,875
Let's see.

(SIGHS)

291
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:35,416
I understand your moral objections
to what the TVA does.

292
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:42,833
And my methods are deceptive.

293
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:46,416
But the mission, it never was.

294
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:51,583
Without the me, without the TVA...

295
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:55,625
everything burns.

296
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:00,333
Then what are you so afraid of?

297
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,416
Me.

298
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,416
And just who are you?

299
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,541
Oh, I've been dubbed many names
by many people.

300
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:24,708
A ruler, a conqueror.

(SNICKERS)

302
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:29,541
He Who Remains, a jerk.

303
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:34,916
But it's... it's not as simple as a name.

304
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:48,708
Eons ago, before the TVA,

305
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:54,000
a variant of myself lived on Earth
in the 31st century.

306
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:56,500
He was a scientist

307
00:20:56,583 --> 00:21:02,625
and he discovered that there were
universes stacked on top of his own.

308
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:07,000
At the same time, other versions of us
were learning the same thing.

309
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:12,958
Naturally, they made contact.
And for a while, there was peace.

310
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:16,416
Narcissistic, self-congratulatory peace.

311
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,166
"I love your shoes." "I love your hair."
"Oh, man, nice nose." "Thanks, man."

312
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,333
Et cetera.

313
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:25,250
They shared technology and knowledge.

314
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:30,166
Using the best of their universes
to improve the others.

315
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:32,541
However...

316
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:38,708
not every version of me

317
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:41,750
was so... so pure of heart.

318
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:48,583
To some of us,
new worlds meant only one thing,

319
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:51,708
new lands to be conquered.

320
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:54,833
The peace between realities...

(IMITATES EXPLOSION)

322
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:02,125
...erupted into all-out war,

323
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:06,500
each variant fighting to preserve
their universe

324
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:09,500
and annihilate the others.

325
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:12,125
This was almost the end... (CHUCKLES)

326
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:15,500
...ladies and gentlemen,
of everything and everyone.

327
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:18,958
And then the Time-Keepers
came along and saved us all.

328
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:26,041
(SINGING) <i>Amen</i>

329
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:29,791
No. (CHUCKLES) No.

330
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:33,250
Nope, this is where we diverge
from the dogma.

331
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:36,333
That first variant encountered a creature

332
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:40,416
created from all the tears in reality,

333
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,791
capable of consuming time
and space itself.

334
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:44,875
A creature...

335
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:48,125
you both know.

336
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:50,916
Alioth.

337
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,500
HE WHO REMAINS: Bingo!

338
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:57,250
I harnessed the beast's power
and began experimenting on it.

339
00:23:01,291 --> 00:23:04,041
I weaponized Alioth

340
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,291
and I ended...
I ended the Multiversal War.

341
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,708
Once I isolated our timeline,

342
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:17,125
all I had to do
was manage the flow of time

343
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:19,083
and prevent any further branches.

344
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:21,625
Hence, the TVA.

345
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:25,583
Hence, the Time-Keepers
and a highly efficient bureaucracy.

346
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:30,958
Hence, ages... (GRUNTS)
...and ages of cosmic harmony.

347
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:32,416
Hence...

348
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:34,458
you're welcome.

349
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,583
You came to kill the devil, right?

350
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:46,208
(CHUCKLES)

351
00:23:46,541 --> 00:23:47,666
Well, guess what?

352
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:51,250
I keep you safe.

353
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:56,916
And if you think I'm evil, well,

354
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:03,208
just wait till you meet my variants.

355
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:12,208
And that's the gambit.

356
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,083
Stifling order or cataclysmic chaos.
(CHUCKLES)

357
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:21,541
You may hate the dictator,
but something... (EXHALES DEEPLY)

358
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:24,541
...far worse is gonna fill that void
if you depose of him.

359
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:30,916
I've lived a million lifetimes.

360
00:24:32,375 --> 00:24:34,500
I've gone through every scenario.

361
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:36,625
This is the only way.

362
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,083
The TVA,

363
00:24:40,416 --> 00:24:41,833
it works.

364
00:24:41,916 --> 00:24:45,041
Or you're a liar.

365
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,375
Or I'm a liar.

366
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,083
So you just...

367
00:24:55,333 --> 00:25:00,125
continue to prune innocent timelines?

368
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:01,208
Mmm-mmm.

369
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:04,333
You two would.

370
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:08,791
There's two options! One...

371
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:13,625
you kill me and destroy all this,
so you don't just have one devil,

372
00:25:13,708 --> 00:25:16,125
you have an infinite amount. Or...

373
00:25:17,291 --> 00:25:18,291
you two.

374
00:25:19,125 --> 00:25:20,541
You two run the thing.

375
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:22,333
You're lying.

376
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:27,791
Why would you give up being in control?

377
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,750
(SIGHS)

378
00:25:35,666 --> 00:25:36,666
Buddy...

379
00:25:39,375 --> 00:25:40,375
I'm tired.

380
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:45,041
And I'm older.

381
00:25:47,291 --> 00:25:48,583
I'm older than I look.

382
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:56,166
This game is for the young, the hungry.

383
00:26:00,416 --> 00:26:02,458
I've gone through a lot of scenarios...

384
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,708
trying to find the right person
to take this spot.

385
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:12,500
It turns out that person came in two.

386
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:14,625
(EXHALES)

387
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:19,916
But it's definitely you two.

388
00:26:21,708 --> 00:26:23,958
So, no more lies.

389
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:28,833
You kill me and the Sacred Timeline
is completely exposed.

390
00:26:28,916 --> 00:26:30,250
Multiversal War.

391
00:26:30,333 --> 00:26:36,333
Or you take over and return to the TVA
as its benevolent rulers.

392
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:41,291
Tell the workforce who they are
and why they do what they do.

393
00:26:42,708 --> 00:26:47,208
You treated real people's lives
like some kind of game.

394
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:52,000
It's not personal, it's practical.

395
00:26:52,083 --> 00:26:54,166
It was personal to me.

396

terrible, horrific things.

But now, we, you...

401

have a chance to do them
for a good reason.

I fibbed earlier when I said
I know how everything's going to go. I...

I know... I knew... (CHUCKLES)
...everything up to a certain point,

410

seven, eight, nine, ten seconds ago.

412

But now I have no idea.

No idea how the rest of this
is going to go.

That's it?

418
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:02,375
This is what happens at the end of time?

419
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:06,833
And now you're just gonna sit there
with all that freedom and...

420
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,583
let us decide your fate?

00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:11,833
Yes!

Yes! Yes! What's the worst
that can happen?

423
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:16,333
You either...

424
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:20,041
take over and my life's work continues

425
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:25,583
or you plunge a blade in my chest
and an infinite amount of me...

426
00:29:27,041 --> 00:29:30,708
start another Multiversal War.
And I just...

427

end up right back here anyways. (CHUCKLES)

And what precisely
is there to think about?

I know the TVA has hurt us both.

But what if by taking him out,

467

we risk unleashing something even worse?

take a minute to think about it.

I promise you from my heart
this isn't about a throne.
